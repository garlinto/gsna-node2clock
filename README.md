# gsna-node2clock
This is a (node.js) program that controls communication between my local sensor network and my clock project that gives me some sensor data and the time, of course.

My home network is made up of Particle Photons (particle.io) and teensys (pjrc.com). Using an rpi as a communication broker, I am using this program to communicate between the particle cloud and the teensy.
